# Elevation Station
Stealing and Duplicating SYSTEM tokens for fun & profit!  We duplicate things, make twin copies, and then ride away.

You have used Metasploit's getsystem and SysInternals PSEXEC for getting system privs, correct?  Well, here's a similar standalone version of that...but without the AV issues...at least for now ðŸ˜¸  

This tool also enables you to become **TrustedInstaller**, similar to what Process Hacker/System Informer can do.  This functionality is very new and added in the latest code release and binary release as of 8/12/2023!

## What it does

ElevationStation is a privilege escalation tool.  It works by borrowing from commonly used escalation techniques involving manipulating/duplicating process and thread tokens.  

## Why reinvent the wheel with yet another privilege escalation utility?

This was a combined effort between avoiding AV alerts using Metasploit and furthering my research into privilege escalation methods using tokens.  In brief: My main goal here was to learn about token management and manipulation, and to effectively bypass AV.  I knew there were other tools out there to achieve privilege escalation using token manip but I wanted to learn for myself how it all works.

## So...How does it work?

Looking through the terribly organized code, you'll see I used two **primary** methods to get SYSTEM so far; stealing a Primary token from a SYSTEM level process, and stealing an Impersonation thread token to convert to a primary token from another SYSTEM level process.  That's the general approach at least.

## CreateProcessAsUser versus CreateProcessWithToken

This was another driving force behind furthering my research.  Unless one resorts to using named pipes for escalation, or inject a dll into a system level process, I couldn't see an easy way to spawn a SYSTEM shell within the same console AND meet token privilege requirements.

<b> Let me explain... </b>

When using CreateProcessWithToken, it ALWAYS spawns a separate cmd shell.  As best that I can tell, this "bug" is unavoidable.  It is unfortunate, because CreateProcessWithToken doesn't demand much as far as token privileges are concerned.  Yet, if you want a shell with this Windows API you're going to have to resort to dealing with a new SYSTEM shell in a separate window

That leads us to CreateProcessAsUser. I knew this would spawn a shell within the current shell, but I needed to find a way to achieve this without resorting to using a windows service to meet the token privilege requirements, namely: 
- SE_ASSIGNPRIMARYTOKEN_NAME
TEXT("SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege")
- SE_INCREASE_QUOTA_NAME
TEXT("SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege")

I found a way around that...stealing tokens from SYSTEM process threads :)  We duplicate the thread IMPERSONATION token, set the thread token, and then convert it to primary and then re-run our enable privileges function.  This time, the enabling of the two privileges above succeeds and we are presented with a shell within the same console using CreateProcessAsUser.  No dll injections, no named pipe impersonations, just token manipulation/duplication. 

## Progress

This has come a long way so far...and I'll keep adding to it and cleaning up the code as time permits me to do so. Thanks for all the support and testing!
